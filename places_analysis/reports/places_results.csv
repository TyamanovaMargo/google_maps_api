From start to finish, the process was smooth and efficient. Their team was responsive, communicative, and kept us updated on the status of our shipment. The goods arrived safely and on time. Nirmana cargo‚Äôs competitive pricing and professional service make them a top choice for cargo needs. I specially want to thank Mr.Herby for his support and will looking forward to work with him in the future. ||| I am very disappointed with the service provided by Nirmana cargo company. The lady of (Colombo branch agent) was extremely unprofessional and does not know how to speak to customers.

We handed over our cargo box to your company on 18th June, and they have promised delivery within 20 to 25 days. However, it has still not been delivered. Every time we call, they are given excuses and stories.

My return flight is on the 18th, and I still have not
received my shipment. What is the solution to this?

Additionally, the lady answering the number mentioned above did not even pick up the phone
until noon, saying she was sleeping until then. This is completely unacceptable and unprofessional.

I would not recommend this cargo service to anyone based on this experience. It has been the worst service I‚Äôve encounteredüëéüëéüëé ||| Dear [nirmana Cargo Service] Team,

I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the prompt and secure delivery of my cargo box to my home. Your efficiency and attention to safety made the entire process smooth and worry-free.

I truly appreciate your professionalism and excellent service. Thank you for ensuring my shipment arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

Looking forward to using your services again in the future excellent ‚ù§Ô∏è ||| üò°üò°üò°üò°ü§¨
No one should send goods to Sri Lanka from this wretched company. Some of our most valuable goods were stolen from this Nirmana Cargo. I posted this review because I can't wait to see someone else get into trouble. Because of thieves like this, we can't send the goods we send home safely. We paid a lot of money and sent them door to door. When they open the customs, they are waiting. They can't get them from customs. Again, they steal the goods while they are packing. They stole this even though they were given a checklist. They are some big thieves. May Nirmana Cargo curse you. ||| I send 02 boxes to SL through niramana cargo and service from U.A.E. Agents are excellent. However, agent who did the delivery in SL spoke to my mother in very harsh manner. Even when he delivered the items i was on the video call with my mother and he spoke to her in an extremely aggressive manner. When my mum told him to not to speak to customers in a aggressive tone also threatened her saying that he will damage our house. I witnessed whole conversation while i was in the phone. This is not acceptable. Nirmana cargo should take whole responsibility of this situation. Really dissatisfied with the staff in SL."

Only to find out, you require an Agent.  Fast forward to Google search and I contacted Alma Cargo and two others, they were priced in the middle and had good reviews, and also, were the easiest to work with over the phone.

The process was smooth, they were available to answer my questions (and I had A LOT!) very quickly and put my mind at ease with the process.

Additionally, they referred an incredible insurance agent and walked us through the registration process.  I am very grateful for them and glad I used their services."

Trouble is they will do a good job of breaking expensive items, stealing items from your boxes and failing to inform of the correct procedures needed to carry your personal goods. To add they will take no responsibility for anything.  I would NOT recommend their services. In it for the money and not to satisfy the customer. Very disappointing!"

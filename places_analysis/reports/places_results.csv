Ramen Hiro,"Japan, 〒160-0021 Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Kabukichō, 1-chōme−12−２ 第58東京ビル B1F",4.3,333,"restaurant, point_of_interest, food, establishment",35.69479449999999,139.7024057,"Amazing ramen!! The pork and chicken broth was rich and super flavourful and the noodles were excellent. We saw them making a new pot of broth right in front of us and it’s 100% authentic. It’s a true hole in the wall (basement) but so worth it. Loved the feel and vibe of the place. ||| Great ramen, great fried rice, gyoza was ok. Such a hole in the wall, but worth every penny. Make sure to get the fried rice which was a very positive surprise. Would definitely come back. ||| A highly satisfying ramen experience. The broth was incredibly rich and flavorful, instantly hitting the spot. While even the ""normal"" option for the fat category had a bit more than some might prefer, it was undeniably delicious; those sensitive to richness might consider the lighter alternative. For the price, we both went for the all toppings special ramen which offered a fantastic value with a quick delivery. The small, cozy interior was quiet, allowing for easy conversation, and any concerns about smell seen in other reviews weren't present during our visit. The fried rice was a little bland, likely overshadowed by the stellar ramen.

You know you're in for a great Tokyo food find when it's underground! ||| Nice quaint place...got served immediately.
Have shared what I ordered in the pic. The pork taste is very strong if that is something you like. I personally found it overwhelming initially but strangely comforting towards the end...options are limited.

Do note that you need to take the stairs down to reach the restaurant.  Door is always closed. ||| Hidden gem! Hole in the wall restaurant right in the heart of Kabukicho near the Godzilla head. Delicious Ramen and Gyoza at a great price. Friendly and fast service! Very Limited seating. They do have a restroom/WC."
Sugoi Niboshi Rāmen Nagi Shinjuku Golden Gai,"Japan, 〒160-0021 Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Kabukichō, 1-chōme−1−１０ ２階",4.2,5451,"restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",35.6937641,139.7045255,"Disappointing from Start to Finish

The experience started in a foul-smelling alley where we had to wait before even entering the restaurant—definitely not the welcoming atmosphere you’d hope for. The menu was limited to just three options, and to make matters worse, you had to pay before eating—probably the first red flag we should’ve taken more seriously.

Once we were finally allowed upstairs, we found ourselves crammed into a tiny, closet-sized room with maybe six chairs total and a single window. We were elbow-to-elbow with strangers, which made for an uncomfortable dining experience before the food even arrived.

When it did, the ramen was incredibly underwhelming. The noodles were thick, eggy, and heavy—not in a satisfying way. The broth was the real disaster: it had the consistency of gravy, the kind you’d expect at Easter dinner, but somehow managed to be even worse. Overpoweringly salty with a strong fishy taste (which I actually don’t mind fishy taste) that ruined any chance of balance or comfort in the bowl.

I ordered pork, but I’m fairly certain I was served cold, dry beef instead. The meat was stale and flavorless. The “seasoned egg” was literally just a plain boiled egg, no seasoning to speak of. While they were generous with green onions, every topping—including that—came with an extra charge. And despite asking for my bowl to be spicy, there was absolutely no heat at all.

Overall, this place felt more like a trap than a treat. With so many better ramen spots out there, this one is an easy pass don’t get drawn in by the art outside. ||| Ramen Nagi is absolutely amazing. It’s a must-go if you’re in Japan.

Let me get straight to the point: this place is worth the hype, and some people just don’t get it—like a certain Sharon Moritz, who clearly doesn’t understand ramen or Japanese culture. If you’re traveling to experience something different, you need to go in with an open mind. Otherwise, what’s the point?

Yes, you wait in the alley—and yes, that’s exactly how it should be. It’s not rude, it’s not dirty—it’s efficient, respectful, and part of the charm. Standing in an alley while waiting for a spot in a legendary ramen shop is part of the experience. Would you rather stand in the middle of the street blocking the way? No. The alley is clean, organized, and even fun if you understand the vibe.

And about the small size of the place—yes, it’s tiny. That’s the beauty of it. It’s focused on quality, not mass production. A small space allows the chefs to perfect every single bowl. Why would you want a big, soulless restaurant that just pumps out mediocre food? No, thank you.

You also pay before you eat, which honestly is brilliant. No awkward waiting for the bill. You enjoy your food, and then you’re free to go. Efficient and simple.

Now, let’s talk about the food:
This was the best ramen I’ve ever had in my life.
So good that I swore I’d never eat ramen again until I’m back in Japan. We were in the area for five days, and we ate at Ramen Nagi most of those days. That’s how incredible it was.

The broth? Unforgettable.
The noodles? Perfect texture.
The flavor? Deep, rich, complex—it hits every note.
You’ll taste ramen in a way you didn’t even know was possible.

The staff? Polite, respectful, kind.
The place has character, culture, and soul.
If you travel just to feel like you’re at home, maybe you shouldn’t be traveling. But if you’re someone who appreciates different ways of doing things—this is where you need to be.

So no—don’t listen to someone who left just a handful of clueless reviews.
Take it from someone who’s been around, knows food, and respects culture.

Highly, highly recommend.
Don’t miss it.
Take pictures, enjoy the atmosphere, and if someone ends up in your shot, just be polite and ask—it’s not hard.
Respect the culture, and it’ll reward you with an experience you’ll never forget. ||| I'm have visit here more than 3 times (I can said that I visit here every time I visit Tokyo). It is always be the best fish ramen in my life. Taste of soup is very complex and delicious. This is should be a must of food destination for everyone who come to tokyo. There are operating 24 hours. There are machine ticket menu within english so it is easy for foreigner to order ramen. Experience local and try this! Love this so muchhhh🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻 ||| The 2 women cooking had personality while the guy working the counter was bland in comparison.

Its one of those entry experiences that didnt make you feel welcome so you want to leave although made the effort to visit.

Im not really a noodle expert. For some reason this shop was saved on my map so i went. One of those random noodle shops up a random alley kinda thing.

I will try another place next time lil ||| Waited for about 45 mins before we go up to the restaurant, and I realized why. It is a small restaurant that maybe can seat about 15 pax. But I am glad that I waited.

The ramen was worth the wait. It is a thicker than typical ramen, chewy and not too hard. The soup base is flavorful and not salty, with a strong hint of fish. It comes by default spicy and you can ask for a non-spicy version. You should try the spicy version if you can.

I give atmosphere a 3-star because this place is a bit cramped and you just come in eat and go. Not a place to eat and talk about your life stories with your friends as there will be people downstairs waiting to come up and take your seat.

Worth the walk to the place and wait. Do give it a try!"

Fukuoka style Tonkotsu ramen.
Takes only a few minutes to finish a bowl.
You can add noodle for free only if you ask for it.
Highly recommended! ||| Ramen taste was great, a lot of Charsiu for US$6, we ordered and in 3 min we had our Ramen served. Totally recomended ||| No frills ramen joint. Quick service. Great for a cheap meal. ||| Felt pretty authentic and noodles were well cooked, broth was good not great - ichiran better and was hoping a little corner place would be better! Great value for money just depends if you want good or great, if great … maybe hunt around! ||| This venue may not be a lot to look at but the food and staff were amazing, and for only 1,050 ¥ it is probably one of the better values on our trip so far. Ben and I had ramen for breakfast / brunch time. We both got the spicy pork. The ramen came in one bowl and the spicy seasoning came in a separate, smaller bowl, which made it easy to regulate the overall heat desired. I poured it all in, and it was delicious. The service was very fast. We had our food within a minute or so. Also, the server left a pitcher of water for us at the table. I will admit, using all the spicy sauce made my throat tingle, and I may have drank more water than usual, but by no means was it too much (I didn’t have the sweats or anything like that). What I liked about this place was the table condiments, which I show in the pictures. When I finished my first round of noodles, and requested more, after adding the condiments, my second bowl of ramen was a totally new experience! We were full at the end of this meal, and the food was tasty. We got a table where we could face each other, which I prefer to the side-by-side layout that is so common in ramen cafes. I would recommend a visit. It reminds me a little of somewhere that would be featured on Guy Fieri’s DDD (Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives). Awesome meal"
Ramen Zundou-ya,"2-chōme-39-3 Kabukichō, Shinjuku City, Tokyo 160-0021, Japan",4.1,1646,"restaurant, point_of_interest, food, establishment",35.6967769,139.701975,"Solid place for some late night ramen! They use a ticket machine that has an English option which is nice, but it is cash-only.

The ramen broth was thick and flavorful with some sesame seeds providing hints of nuttiness occasionally. The noodles were thin, and the eggs were the perfect consistency. The pork Chashu was sliced a bit too thinly, so it fell apart into the noodles instead of being it's own element.

The gyoza were solid with a nice crisp sear on the bottom without being oily.

The garlic fried rice was extremely garlicky which I loved, but the fried whole garlic cloves might be a bit too much for some people. ||| I visited it here 2 times for Tokyo trip. This ramen tastes great and has thick and rich soup. Also Gyoza is good! wish come here again. ||| The place was good, it was our first meal in Japan and it was very relieving. The broth was good and not too heavy, while the gyouzas were simple but good. All this paired to a fairly inexpensive price, it is a great spot. ||| Walk in on Sunday night and it was not too busy.  Purchase tickets in the front entrance, then passing it to the staff for your order.  It can be very confusing if you don’t know what you want to eat.  I noticed most of the customers are local and they just order a bowl of ramen and beer etc.  price is reasonable but not cheap.  We tried a few items and surprising the fried rice is really good that we need to re order.  Seating is spacious and staffs are friendly and helpful. ||| I tried the spicy seasoned ramen here and it was absolutely perfect-just the right balance of flavor and spice. They even provided an adult disposable bib, which was a thoughtful touch to keep my clothes clean. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, and the hospitality was top-notch. Plus, the pricing was very reasonable for the quality. Highly recommend for anyone craving great ramen with excellent service!"
Ramen Kaguraya,"Japan, 〒160-0023 Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Nishishinjuku, 7-chōme−16−１０ 西新宿ミカエラビル 1階",4.2,356,"restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",35.69637589999999,139.6977784,"This is the best ramen I have had in the longest time. I had the creamy roasted chicken. The broth was both creamy and very tasty with thin noodles, roasted chicken, napa, scallions,and garlic flakes. The two young men working there were very friendly and very welcoming. Please go there this place is a hidden gem. ||| Yum. At first I was a bit underwhelmed by the soup (I had the light chicken maybe that’s why), but there’s a sign that says if you think the soup is too light, they can provide more tare for you which is nice. In the end I didn’t need it though - the pepper grinder and garlic chips on the table took the bowl a long way.

The noodles weren’t my favourite type, but they work well with the light soup. Toppings were good. While the chicken was somewhat unremarkable, what stood out to me surprisingly were the chopped greens and how well they meshed with the overall light theme of the bowl.

I’m excited to try the tomato chicken next time, seems to have rave reviews. ||| Best chicken ramen we’ve ever had, hands down! What a GREAT find just off the JR line in Shinjuku!!!

Staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was delicious!

Make the time if you’re in the area, you won’t be disappointed!!! ||| Small-ish restaurant that specializes in chicken based ramen (capacity limited to roughly 18 seats). They also have a delicious tomato based ramen available as well. No drinks are served here, only wholesome and warming food.
The torisoba and tomato based tsukemen that we got were tasty and filling without being too rich. The pieces of chicken that came with the bowls were well cooked and lightly seasoned so you could really enjoy the juicy chicken as is. The egg that came with the ramen was perfect. I was not a big fan of the chicken meatball but it was still very tender and may be a personal dis preference. ||| Honestly one of the best meals I’ve had during my Japan trip! We were looking for a late night dinner. Super friendly service. This was our first time venturing into chicken ramen and it did not disappoint. The spicy tsukemen is highly recommended.

P.S Don’t be alarmed by all of the green onions and garlic. Those were my add-ons, lol."
Ramen Jiro Shinjuku Kabukicho,"Japan, 〒160-0021 Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Kabukichō, 2-chōme−37−５ 日新ビル 1F",3.6,2577,"restaurant, point_of_interest, food, establishment",35.6961205,139.7019533,"This place is for you if you like really fatty/oily salty ramen and bean sprouts. The chasu was so so, but the broth? It was too salty, I couldn’t finish it. Also, make sure you can slurp your bowl of ramen as fast as you can so that you don’t annoy the people waiting in line, haha 🙈 ||| It's like a ramen fast food joint. You get in line and when you get to the ticket machine, everything was in Japanese, no English. I had to use my phone to translate the entire menu on the kiosk and buy the ticket.

Once you gotten the ticket, you stand in line and take your own cup of water and spoon while you wait for your seat.

When the food arrives, it's like a race! Everyone is trying to finish their food as fast as possible and get out. Quality wise i think is really mediocre and not suitable for family or if you are a slow eater  You feel the pressure to eat at lighting speed and leave...

Overall it's an experience but I wouldn't return again.. ||| This is a unique yet shocking ramen experience in my world ramen tour. This is no place for tourists. You have been warned.

You get to sit among real host boys. They are hungry and in a rush. Ramen is extremely cheap given its excessive portion. Heavy pork oil, thick noodle and enough bean sprouts to meet what your digestion system needs. You have to clean up after eating it. Eating slowly seems to be a disrespect to the people who are waiting in the line. They are in a rush to eat and go back to work. The pressure of finishing it quickly really shakes my core idea about Japan.

It doesn’t taste too good. But It seems to keep the area vibrant and alive.

This time, I will give only 3 stars just like what Japanese would do. ||| It's the worst place to eat the best ramen of your life. It was ridiculously tasty and cheap ,the pork the soup the ramen everything!!! But the place is not good. The staff are 3 men working very hard and if you take too long to eat your food they tell you to eat faster because there are many people waiting. I am a fat guy and I didn't have enough space to eat, maybe it's the worst table I have ever sat at in a restaurant 😅. Although you do have to taste it. The experience alone is worth it. ||| After trying Senrigan, I felt compelled to try authentic Jiro-style ramen, so I visited Ramen Jiro Shinjuku. As expected from Jiro ramen, the combination of garlic and pork broth was good, but I was disappointed that it didn't offer anything beyond that. I felt it needed a stronger spice. The staff was friendly, and the restaurant felt spacious for the number of seats, which was a pleasant change."
HALAL WAGYU YAKINIKU & RAMEN NARUTO -鳴門-,"Japan, 〒150-0042 Tokyo, Shibuya, Udagawachō, 13−８ Chitosekaikan 2F",4.8,1360,"restaurant, point_of_interest, food, establishment",35.66106349999999,139.6985057,"We had the BBQ and it was good but not worth the price… 9 pieces of meat for over 5000 yen with barely any sides. I’d rather have something else for the money especially considering that I had better Wagyu for less. Would not recommend the yakiniku. Didn’t try the ramen though so don’t know how that is but also that is more expensive than other halal ramen places. The service was super nice though. ||| Looking for authentic halal food in the heart of Shibuya? This is the place.

I was searching for “Shibuya halal restaurant” and came across HALAL WAGYU YAKINIKU & RAMEN NARUTO.

What convinced me to visit was the fact that the Egyptian Embassy has actually dined here. That kind of trust speaks volumes, especially when choosing a halal-friendly restaurant in Japan.

The halal ramen immediately stood out – rich broth with a deep umami flavor, perfectly balanced and comforting. It had that warm, homemade feel but with a level of refinement you’d expect at a high-end spot.

The wagyu yakiniku was unforgettable – beautifully seared on the outside and incredibly tender inside. Each bite was melt-in-your-mouth perfection.

I also tried the tempura – light, crispy, and full of flavor. You could really taste the quality of the vegetables and shrimp.

To top it all off, they serve halal-certified non-alcoholic beer. It was surprisingly crisp and refreshing, pairing well with every dish.

What really made the experience complete, though, was the service. The staff were warm, attentive, and clearly experienced in serving international guests. I felt genuinely welcomed, and that meant a lot.

If you're looking for Shibuya halal Japanese food, this place should be at the top of your list. Whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or bringing Muslim guests, you can trust this spot for both quality and peace of mind.

‏إذا كنت تبحث عن طعام حلال عالي الجودة في Shibuya، فهذا هو المكان المناسب.
‏المطعم معتمد من السفارة المصرية ويقدم لحم Wagyu ومأكولات يابانية حلال بجودة ممتازة.
‏الخدمة رائعة والأجواء مريحة، أنصح به للمسلمين والزوار من الخارج. ||| Great experience. A little steep for the amount of food you get but worth the experience if you haven’t had halal wagyu before.

Service was excellent. Prayer room available. Can pay by card or cash. One vegan ramen on the menu. ||| We were greeted by friendly staffs. Food was amazing. The Naruto wagyu set was amazing, we had to order another set! My family truly enjoyed our experience here. Highly recommended! ||| The food was delicious! First time trying wagyu streak and it did not disappoint! I'm glad i tried it here! It was a very good price for everything you got i would fully recommend! And you get to cook it yourself to your liking!!"

We didn't really get curious about the ramen until after we already ate. Ramen broth was kept hot and rich living up to its name, pork bankara ramen. We also had the pork skewer on rice with raw egg, gyoza, and chinese siumai. The only thing is that we came in as a party of 12. And ordered before the rest of the group, but our order wasn't coming until I came up to the restaurant personnel. It turned out our meal ticket after payment didn't get collected. ||| Ramen and fried chicken done right. We were a group of ten and we have no complaints. ||| This place deserves a Michelin
Best ramen for me 🙌🏼🙌🏼 must try this one if you like pork ramen.

10/10 ❗️ ||| Always saw this place on YouTube live stream. So I tried it. The result is that it is very good and tasty ramen, chicken wings and great refreshing drinks. The guy who runs the place is very nice and speaks a little English! Clean toilets also. ||| Tried Bankara Ramen just to grab a quick bite — pretty solid. Good flavors, decent portions, and enough variety to keep you coming back maybe once a month to try something new. Not bad at all"

Order with the machine so it is easy. The ramen is delicious to me, but the price is a little higher compared to regular ramen, with a small portion size of noodles. So you will buy extra noodles.

Still a good ramen overall. ||| I loved the ramen at this place; it's possibly one of the best value places in Tokyo. I ordered the classic ramen with pork and green onions, mild spice, medium noodle texture, medium dashi, garlic, and medium richness. The broth was incredibly flavorful. This dish cost me 1,080 yen and water is free.
The only downside is that the place is small, and we had to wait in line for over an hour to sit down and eat. They don't take reservations and one of the most relevant features of the site is that you eat alone.
I recommend it. ||| The food was absolutely delicious, with the noodles packed full of rich, savory flavor. The service was smooth and well-organized, showing that the restaurant has a solid, professional setup. The dining area felt very private, which made the experience even more enjoyable. We went late in the evening, so there was no long wait—definitely a bonus. The soft-boiled egg was perfectly cooked, with just the right texture and taste. A great spot for a satisfying and well-executed meal! ||| This restaurant was a bucket list item for me. We had lunch at exactly 12pm with a wait time of  only a 10 minutes. The ordering process was easy to follow and the food arrived within a few minutes of being seated. You have a semi private eating area and i do highly recommend eating here. On our way out the line was really long so I suggest dropping by outside of peak hours. ||| This is a popular ramen restaurant,and there is still a long line of people waiting. When you arrive, you need to go down to the basement to get a queue number, but you can check the queue through your mobile phone, which is very convenient. I like the taste of the food. It is well-rounded and delicious. It may be because you can choose the softness of the noodles, the richness of the soup, the amount of garlic, or even the vegetables. The atmosphere is unique. Everyone eats in their own cubicle. The staff is very private, but you can press a button to call them"

It was a bigger shop than some of the popular ones so they are able to take in more groups rather than just solos or couples. I remember I enjoyed their noodles texture with it being quite springy. A pity I didn't get to try the signature ones so I would like to go again. ||| When I passed by this store and so hungry, there is a machine outside and I noticed that vegetarian should be hesitated.
After ordering the meals, I talked to staff Yurika that please prepare my meal without meat, she was so kind and detail-oriented ask me if the shrimp dumplings with pork is ok or not.

Few minutes later, she took a menu that I can choose the vegetables to replace meats.
So amazing right, isn’t it?

Traveling in Japan many times, it’s the first time I felt so much cared!

Thank you! And the food are really nice. ||| Delicious ramen for our last night in Tokyo!

You order at the machine outside, put your cash in first and then press the button of what you want before going inside to sit down.

Highly recommend if you’re looking for a solid ramen spot. ||| I only had rich and heavy ones before like tonkotsu or miso, so it was my first time trying shio ramen. I really loved yuzu touch in the ramen, which makes the flavor light and flavorful. With green onion, it definitely has ‘cleaner’ taste than other types of ramen. Service was quick. They only accept cash. ||| The Tonkotsu Ramen flavour was weak...
You purchase a ticket using the vending machine and then line up to enter the restaurant.
Service was quite slow, was served 20 mins later despite waiting outside for close to 30 mins.
Variety of condiments on each table, which is probably due to the weak soup taste.
Karage was okay, Gyoza tasted like frozen product."

Order on a machine that doesn’t have English settings (which is fine, just be prepared for what you want to order). I ordered the chicken paitan, it was fine. Just made me realize I’m not a paitan person. They have the reddest yolks I have ever seen during my time in Japan. Overall good ramen spot. ||| This is probably some of the best ramen I have had in Japan, certainly in Tokyo. I had the soy sauce special ramen and it was delicious - a broth deep in flavour. My boyfriend had the chicken and duck special. So satisfying. It is worth visiting here, it’s down a little side street so certainly one you need to seek out (you won’t just stroll across it!). From what I have read on other reviews there can be lines, however we came at 4pm-ish and we were able to order and sit down straight away.

You need to order at the machine that is just inside the door. It has an English setting if helpful. I couldn’t see there was anywhere to pay by card, but I had cash anyway so wasn’t really looking for it - so maybe just bring cash so you are not disappointed! If I was in Japan longer I would certainly be visiting again to sample the whole menu!!! ||| A beautiful and modern ramen shop. The reviews aren’t wrong, this place has some of the tastiest broth you’ll have. The ramen was delicious but we really loved this spot as it was quiet and we didn’t feel rushed unlike most other spots. The staff were also so nice. This place felt like they cared heaps about every bowl they served. The meat was also incredible, unlike anything we’ve had in Japan so far. ||| First ramen experience in Tokyo, and it was amazing. The broth has a rich flavor without being heavy, and it’s very affordable at 1200 yen. Excellent noodles, perfectly cooked egg, and high-quality meat. I highly recommend it. The place is small, there’s usually a line, but it moves fairly quickly. Great service and atmosphere. 🍜❤️‍🩹 ||| Probably the best ramen in Tokyo.

We stumbled across this ramen restaurant while looking for something to eat in Shinjuku. And we certainly didn't regret it.

You will probably have to wait between 15 and 30 minutes to be seated, depending on how busy it is.

The machine from where you order does not have menu in English despite using a touchscreen and it accepts only cash.

We liked this ramen so much that we decided to come back the next day and have another round."

The yuzu was clean and fresh and the chicken was creamy and rich, with bouncy noods and great toppings. loved them both, would highly recommend!! ||| I originally planned to eat at a famous restaurant, but the line was so long that I gave up and wandered around—then I stumbled upon this little place by chance. I got so lucky! The food was delicious, the prices were reasonable, the atmosphere was cozy, and the staff were super friendly. It feels like I just discovered a hidden gem in Tokyo. ||| This was our first ramen in Japan and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Cosy little space with really tasty food, and the staff are super friendly. I got the fried chicken with pork and it was unbelievably tasty. Definitely go here! ||| The oreyushio special was really good! Yummy broth and karaage. The workers were very friendly and gave us a baby chair for our little one. The gyoza was also very tasty.

Chef Kazu came out to greet customers personally. Hassan was also very helpful. They even let me charge my phone while I enjoyed my meal. Food is delicious, had the waygu ramen set and I was so full after that. Flavour was on point. I will definitely be back. Highly recommend! ||| Came for the vegan ramen option, it was very mediocre. The noodles did not taste fresh, the quality doesn’t compare to any other ramen i’ve had in Japan. They resembled instant ramen noodles. The broth was also quite bland, although they brought a spicy paste upon request that improved it. The vegetables served in the ramen did not really make sense with the dish. My brother got the special ramen with karrage and wagyu and was not impressed. Not much wagyu at all. For the most expensive ramen we’ve had in Japan, it was also the worst. May be a good option if you eat halal but for vegetarians there are far better options. The servers were kind which is good. ||| Great alternative to the normal tonkotsu based ramen. The chicken karaage was really nice. We had the white based ramen and the noodles were cooked perfectly; nicely balanced broth too ||| * The Spicy Wagyu Ramen was heartwarming. Though some may find it the broth exceedingly rich, you can add kimchi to introduce some acidity to balance.
* The gyukatsu and gyoza included as part of the set were good, but not particularly memorable
* For dessert, they have refreshing strawberry milk pudding. ||| Amazing experience at Gyumon Shinjuku. We were warmly served by Emon. A good break from the hot and busy streets outside. Food was so so delicious! One of the best ramen broths I've tasted!!"

We accidentally ordered too much as we didn’t realise that everything you tapped on the screen was added to your basket, so the kind lady refunded us.
The ramen itself was soo delicious. We had the spicy miso and tonkostu ramen and both were excellent. Free noodle refills too! ||| We had the spicy miso ramen and the tonkotsu ramen and they were both very flavorful and delicious. The atmosphere is cozy and super friendly. So many free add-ons too. I loved it ||| I really loved the broth. The flavor is SUPERB. Having the free 2 noodle refills was so delightful. I cannot wait to come back!

You order on a kiosk then wait to be seated. It reminds me of a cozy diner. ||| The noodles are okay. Their clerk is really nice. Because they accidentally ordered an extra noodle, they refunded the money without saying a word when they finally inquired. ||| The garlic ramen tastes really good here. It has a unique taste. I liked that it didn't taste like fish or pork. You can get two free refills of noodles. The eggs in the ramen were also very good. I would recommend ordering an extra egg. The order is made at a machine that also can be changed to English."

Noodles has a nice chewy texture. Not sure if we were suppose to tell the staff how we like our noodles, saltiness and oil (as per the picture) but the staff did not asked us. So the soup turns out abit too salty for my liking ||| Very good Ramen & super friendly staff. They even gifted me an umbrella on my way out because it started raining. Highly recommended. And thanks for the umbrella! :) ||| I had the ""チャーシュー麺 (肩ロース) 並"" / ""Char siu noodles (shoulder loin) regular size"" (third choice) with flavoured egg - total was ¥1250.
I was asked about noodle firmness, broth intensity and oiliness (they have an English card to show those options).
Overall unassuming but great value and tasty Iekei ramen in the middle of Shinjuku, would recommend! ||| Great food and kind people. Broth is a bit lighter than the usual for this type of ramen (which is good!) making an easy digestion. Rice could be a bit better. Super fair price ||| Hopefully we get the place right as I couldn’t find any English name on the menu. This place is located in Kabukicho or near the Godzilla Hotel Gracery and Hotel Groove Shinjuku. The ramen was ok but what I really love is the karage ( fried Japanese chicken ). You have to order through the vending machine, pay first and then hand over the ticket to a server."

I tried both the cold summer ramen and the rich soy-based hot ramen both were excellent.

The chilled ramen was light, refreshing, and full of umami. The noodles were smooth and the toppings were super fresh.

The hot ramen had a deep, flavorful broth with tender slices of pork and just the right amount of fat. So satisfying!

Highly recommend this place if you love quality ramen with great balance and taste. ||| Ramen Takahashi Shinjuku Main Store was a disappointment for me. The broth destroyed the food for me. Probably because i am not a big fan of these kind of fishy grilled/burn taste. I even ordered the Japanese variant without soup…

The location needs a refurbishment. The place only takes cash, so I needed to run over the street to withdraw money from the ATM. ||| I’ve eaten here a couple of times, and I love their ramen! It could be a bit salty and fatty for other people, but for me, it was just the right balance of flavors! The noodles, broth, and chasu were on point. I always finish the whole bowl without any leftovers. One of my favorite ramen shop in Shinjuku. ||| Really rich broth and tender meats. It was a bit salty for my boyfriend but I really enjoyed it.

Update: was so good I went back again but unfortunately this time they gave me less meat and an egg despite me ordering the same thing. Still yummy though. ||| Delicious ramen specializing in anchovy/ salty fish broth. In my opinion, the broth is pretty good and I can understand why in the reviews that it may taste ""burnt"". That might just be the anchovy taste as the anchovies are also roasted.
Their soy sauce ramen is also pretty good as well.
CASH only. Order from outside vending machine. Enter shop and sit on counter and place your order ticket on the upper counter.
See photos for actual shop entrance.

Definitely recommend to stop by and grab quick delicious ramen."

Don’t let the small size fool you—CoCo Ichibanya delivers big on flavour. The curry was absolutely amazing—rich, customizable, and full of comfort. Service was fast, friendly, and super welcoming. The place itself was clean and had a cozy, relaxed vibe. Easily one of those hole-in-the-wall experiences that turns into a highlight of your trip. Highly recommend! ||| My favorite place for Ramen! Surprised to see that they have a branch at Shinjuku. Have never seen an Ichiran branch without a long queue, so bring a lot of patience when visiting this place. Highly recommended and will definitely visit again! ||| Ichiran was a solid choice for a quick and satisfying meal. There was no queue when we arrived and orders were placed via a vending machine at the entrance. English menu was available. The service was efficient, the flavors hit the spot, and everything ran smoothly—nothing much to complain about. ||| Must check in before entering. Will be givin a receipt with wait time on an app and once the app lets you know it’s your turn you can return and order your food and begin the experience that you came here for. I’m not a big ramen fan but my daughter loves it so we had to stop. It was actually amazing and so delicious. ||| Really good ramen! We got the plain one (no pork) and it was super flavorful. I don’t recommend the extra half portion though (it’s super filling).
The experience is very Japanese you sit in your own little cubicle, def worth trying."

The refreshing hint of lemon adds a nice touch, making the overall taste more refreshing and helping to cut through the richness. However, the meat could be a bit more tender, as it felt a little dry. Overall, it's definitely a place worth trying! ||| Great small informal spot near Yoyogi station we stopped into on the way back from Meiji Shrine.  The food and bear were excellent and the waitress pa helped us figure out the menu and vending type ordering process.  I would definitely recommend this spot for a quick meal, ||| Incredible restaurant! The food is some of the best we’ve had in Japan, restaurant is unique in the best way, and everyone was so nice! ||| My first time to Japan, first time to a Japanese noodle place by the train station. The proprietor was a cool dude with a great attitude and helped us even though we spoke no Japanese. Would highly recommend. ||| This restaurant deserves a much better rating than the current 3.9 stars! During our 3 week Japan round trip (and we had countless portions of ramen) the ramen of Tomirai stood out with their rich and complex flavours and generous toppings. Especially the pork meat was really tender and delicious. We can highly recommend this place!"

Order machine only accepts 1000 notes. The shop says you can exchange with them but sometimes they run out of small notes to change into ||| Found this restaurant just by walking around Shinjuku. It's a small place with room for about 10 guests, bar style. Order from the vending machine and give the ticket to the chef and take a seat.

The descriptions on the machine aren't the best (at least in English), but I was pretty pleased with what I ordered which was the tomato shrimp ramen with extra pork and an egg (~1400 yen). The broth had a really unique shrimp taste to it that I enjoyed. The only caveat to this I'd add is a couple of people from our group had some really bad stomach problems after we ate here, but hard to say if it was directly because of it.

A lot of the reviews seem to make the chef sound unpleasant but he was quite nice to us. I also got a chance to observe how he makes the food and he puts quite a lot of effort into making the ramen noodles perfectly layered, and you can tell from the plating that he puts effort into that too. ||| To be honest, ramen is average, but the male staff has a really terrible manner, even if everything is good but it's not enough to cover the staff like this attitude. This is not like what the Japanese service way. By the way, the desk is not clean. Anyway, I don't understand why this ramen restaurant could be achieved above 4+ of points like this, it's not worth it to be. I am really not recommended for this restaurant. ||| nestled in an unassuming corner of the city, this small ramen store proved to be a hidden gem, offering the best ramen i have ever tasted. from the moment i walked in, the cozy atmosphere and the mouthwatering aroma of simmering broth set the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.

one of the unique aspects of this ramen shop is the ordering process. upon entering, you're greeted by a vending machine that displays the menu options. this method is not only efficient but also adds a modern twist to the traditional ramen experience. after selecting my ramen type and any additional toppings, i received a ticket, which i handed to the ramen chef behind the counter. the interaction was minimal, but this streamlined process allowed for a quick and smooth transition from ordering to enjoying the meal.

the ramen itself was nothing short of extraordinary. the broth was rich and flavorful, clearly simmered to perfection over several hours. it had a deep, umami taste that was both comforting and invigorating. the noodles were perfectly cooked, maintaining the right balance of chewiness and firmness. toppings such as tender slices of chashu pork, a perfectly soft-boiled egg, and fresh green onions complemented the dish wonderfully, enhancing the overall flavor without overwhelming the palate.

this ramen store is not designed for large groups, as its intimate setting is better suited for individuals or small parties seeking a quiet, delicious meal. the limited seating adds to the charm, making each visit feel special and personal.

in conclusion, this small ramen shop offers a dining experience that is both efficient and exceptionally satisfying. the quality of the ramen speaks for itself, making it a must-visit for any ramen enthusiast. whether you're a local or just passing through, do yourself a favor and indulge in a bowl of the best ramen you'll ever eat. ||| the place is cozy and the food is crazy tasty, the chef was extremely nice and very accommodating with me not being able to eat pork plus he tweaked the recipe for me and my friend. the place is not big but it’s spacious and the chef speaks english really well (so for those travelers, this place is recommended). i got the shrimp tomato ramen and it’s just amazing, you can taste the shrimp very clearly and its really really good"
